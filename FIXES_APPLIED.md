# BoostMaster Plugin - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Method Implementations
**Problem**: Several methods were declared in `BoostMaster.h` but not implemented in `BoostMaster.cpp`.

**Fixed Methods**:
- `SaveTrainingDrill(const std::string& name)`
- `LoadTrainingDrill(const std::string& name)`
- `ListTrainingDrills()`
- `DeleteTrainingDrill(const std::string& name)`
- `LoadAllTrainingDrills()`
- `SaveAllTrainingDrills()`
- `loadHistory()`

**Solution**: Implemented all missing methods with proper error handling, file I/O for JSON training drills, and CSV history loading.

### 2. Undefined Global Variable
**Problem**: `pathAlgo` was declared as `extern` but never defined.

**Solution**: Changed `extern int pathAlgo;` to `int pathAlgo = 0;` in `BoostMaster.cpp`.

### 3. Uninitialized Global CVar Manager
**Problem**: `_globalCvarManager` was declared but never initialized, causing LOG_ERROR calls to fail.

**Solution**: Added `_globalCvarManager = cvarManager;` in the `onLoad()` method.

### 4. Missing Class Member
**Problem**: `BoostHUDWindow.cpp` referenced `plugin->avgBoostPerMinute` but this field was not declared in `BoostMaster.h`.

**Solution**: Added `float avgBoostPerMinute = 0.0f;` to the `BoostMaster` class.

### 5. Circular Dependencies
**Problem**: Multiple header files had circular includes causing compilation issues:
- `BoostMaster.h` included `BoostHUDWindow.h`
- `BoostHUDWindow.h` included `BoostMaster.h`
- Similar issues with `BoostSettingsWindow.h`, `BoostPadHelper.h`, and `BoostMasterUI.h`

**Solution**: 
- Replaced `#include` statements with forward declarations in header files
- Kept the actual includes in the corresponding `.cpp` files where the full class definitions are needed

**Files Modified**:
- `BoostMaster.h` - Added forward declarations for `BoostHUDWindow` and `BoostSettingsWindow`
- `BoostHUDWindow.h` - Replaced include with forward declaration for `BoostMaster`
- `BoostSettingsWindow.h` - Replaced include with forward declaration for `BoostMaster`
- `BoostPadHelper.h` - Replaced include with forward declaration for `BoostMaster`
- `BoostMasterUI.h` - Replaced include with forward declaration for `BoostMaster`

## Training Drill System Implementation

The training drill system now supports:
- **Saving drills**: Captures current car position, rotation, ball position, and ball velocity
- **Loading drills**: Restores saved positions and states
- **Listing drills**: Shows all available saved drills
- **Deleting drills**: Removes unwanted drill configurations
- **Persistence**: Saves/loads drill data to/from `data/training_drills.json`

## Boost History System Implementation

The boost history system now supports:
- **CSV Loading**: Reads existing boost history from `data/boost_history.csv`
- **Efficiency Calculation**: Computes efficiency metrics from historical data
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing or corrupted data files

## Build Status

All major compilation issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Missing method implementations
- ✅ Undefined variables
- ✅ Uninitialized global objects
- ✅ Circular dependencies
- ✅ Missing class members

The plugin should now compile successfully with Visual Studio/MSBuild.
